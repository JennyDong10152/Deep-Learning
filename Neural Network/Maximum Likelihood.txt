Maximum Likelihood ->
    Goal: pick the model that gives the existing labels in our historical data (which we know are correct)(training set) the highest probability
          find the model that would produce the greatest P(all), product of all independent probabilities of each datapoint. This indicates how well the model performs in classifying all datasets
sigmoid function (Ïƒ(x)): maps any real-valued number to a range between 0 and 1
